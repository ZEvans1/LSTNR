#### _A mobile app intended to match user travel times with podcasts / playlists of similar duration. Android week 1 @ Epicodus, Mar. 16, 2018._

#### By _**Zach Evans**_

## Idea/Explanation

_This app is intended for users who would like to find podcasts or song playlists to listen to while they travel. The user inputs travel times and is given an average travel time. Later, API calls will return media for the user to listen to see track durations._

### Specs
| Behavior | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :-------------
| **Returns an average of numbers**| {1, 2, 3} | 2 |


## Future work
* Immediate first steps are to make sure data is preserved while navigating through all of the activities. Currently, data is just passed between the Travel and Listen activities.
* Implement API calls for podcasts / songs.
* Implement a database so user data is stored.
* Potentially move towards making travel objects that allow for more functions, like searches tailored to mode of transport or day of week.
